# spring-soy-react-template
A template for Spring MVC project integrated with soy and react, built with Ant

**ant tasks (to be run in project root directory)**

`ant generate-parseinfo-soy` will compile soy templates into java classes and store them in `build-transient-src`

`ant resolve` retrieves library jars into /war/WEB-INF/lib

`ant compile` compiles java source code to /war/WEB-INF/classes

`ant package` creates a WAR file for deployment and stores it in /target

**npm scripts (to be run in web application root directory)**

`npm run build` transpiles and bundles javascript source code

`npm run lint` checks code styles and looks for potential bugs in javascript source code

**run the project**

1. Set up local tomcat server by [downloading a tomcat distribution](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi)
2. Make sure tomcat is running locally - localhost:8080 (can be started by running the startup script in /bin in tomcat directory)
3. Simply run `ant` in project root if you have $CATALINA_HOME set up
   If not, manually copy WAR file generated by `ant package` into /webapps in tomcat directory
4. Go to localhost:8080/dream and localhost:8080/dream/hello
